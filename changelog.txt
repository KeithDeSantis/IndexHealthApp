1.0.0
Initial release

1.1.0
* Refactored app to be built using REACT.
* Edited index_input_health.xml datasource search string to address edge case. When assigning status changed "<" to "<=" to avoid no status being applied when values were equal.
* Fixed typos in Index Input Health Dashboard to not include timeframes in table titles.
* Removed "+%Q" timezone formatting from strptime command in dashboard search. Since different environments will have different timezones Splunk may return text with "+" or "-", this way it is simply ignored and won't fail to parse.

1.2.0 (live)
* Created new REACT component named ConfigurationParametersTable to handle all configurations other than the status windows.
* Added last_log_time_format and known_missing_indices macros:
    * last_log_time_format - Allows the admin to define a custom Splunk time format string to display in the LastLogReceived column in the dashboard
    * known_missing_indices - A list of indices that are retired and expected to not be receiving logs but are maintained to be searchable. This will filter these known missing indices from the dashboard.
* Reformatted HTML and style sheets to spread out parameters table in the GUI
* Changed the HrsSinceLastLog column for the Common Indices table to be read in minutes, now named MinsSinceLastLog
* Added functionality to check if configuration value inputs are empty and reset them to defaults
