1.0.0
Initial release

1.1.0 (live)
* Refactored app to be built using REACT.
* Edited index_input_health.xml datasource search string to address edge case. When assigning status changed "<" to "<=" to avoid no status being applied when values were equal.
* Fixed typos in Index Input Health Dashboard to not include timeframes in table titles.
* Removed "+%Q" timezone formatting from strptime command in dashboard search. Since different environments will have different timezones Splunk may return text with "+" or "-", this way it is simply ignored and won't fail to parse.
